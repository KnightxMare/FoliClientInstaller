# Foli Client Installer

Installs the Foli Client modpack

## Notes
- ReplayMod is included, but autorecording is disabled by default. If you're using it on TG, remember not to abuse it to see where you shouldn't, or gain any unfair advantage.
- ReplayMod depends on FFmpeg to function correctly. The FFmpeg executable has been included, meaning Windows users don't need to do anything, however, if you're on a Mac or Linux machine you will need to install FFmpeg manually. For more info go to [Replaymod's website](https://www.replaymod.com/).
- Voxelmap's Menu key has been remapped from `m` to `` ` `` (the one above `Tab` on English keyboards), and Cave Mode and Radar have been disabled.
- To activate the Light Overlay, press `f7`
