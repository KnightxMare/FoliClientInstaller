# Foli Client

This is the installer for the Foli Client modpack.

## What is Foli Client?

Foli Client is a customized, preconfigured modpack intended to provide a player with useful tools for technical Minecrft. In addition, mods are configured by default to be legal on the TeenagersGaming Minecraft Server. Here is an explanation of the various mods included:

## Installation Instructions:

1. Create a **fresh** profile/instance of Minecraft. If using the default launcher, it is recommended to create a different installation directory for the profile you will be using for Foli Client. **I strongly suggest using MultiMC**, as it makes it easy to manage multiple Minecraft profiles, and allows you to install Fabric with one click.
2. Install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/). **Do not install Fabric API**, as the appropriate version is included in the modpack.
3. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/ablazingeboy/FoliClientInstaller/releases) page, and unzip it. **Do not move any of the files from the folder where they were unzipped.**
4. Run the installer for your OS (`FoliClientInstaller.exe` for Windows, `FoliClientInstaller.app` for MacOS, and `FoliClientInstaller.py` for other platforms). When prompted, paste in the **full filepath** of your Minecraft install directory (e.g. C:\Users\ABlazingEBoy\Documents\MinecraftDirectory or  )

## Notes
- The Python script is written for Python 3.9, and *should* work on any OS, although I haven't done any testing on Linux as I don't currently have a machine with a Linux distro installed.
- If you don't want to run the installer, you can also just manually copy all of the folders in the `resources` folder in the zip to your Minecraft install directory
- ReplayMod is included, but autorecording is disabled by default. If you're using it on TG, remember not to abuse it to see where you shouldn't, or gain any unfair advantage.
- ReplayMod depends on FFmpeg to function correctly. The FFmpeg executable has been included, meaning Windows users don't need to do anything, however, if you're on a Mac or Linux machine you will need to install FFmpeg manually. For more info go to [Replaymod's website](https://www.replaymod.com/).
- Voxelmap's Menu key has been remapped from `m` to `` ` `` (the one above `Tab` on English keyboards), and Cave Mode and Radar have been disabled.
- To activate the Light Overlay, press `f7`
